House Price Prediction Model- Linear Regression


Problem Statement:

Consider a real estate company has a data set of the prices in the region of Delhi. It wishes to use the data to optimise the sale prices of the properties, based on important factors such as area, bedrooms, parking, etc.

 

Essentially the company wants:

    To identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g. area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.

    To create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables such as number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.

    To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables predict house prices.
