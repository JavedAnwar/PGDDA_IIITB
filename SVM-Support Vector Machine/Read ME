Business Understanding

A classic problem in the field of pattern recognition is that of handwritten digit recognition. The goal is to develop a model that can correctly identify the digit (between 0-9) written in an image. 

 
Objective

To develop a model using Support Vector Machine which should correctly classify the handwritten digits from 0-9 based on the pixel values given as features. Thus, this is a 10-class classification problem.
