Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:

It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment

It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in

For your analysis, consider a country to be English speaking only if English is one of the official languages in that country

->What is the strategy?

Spark Funds wants to invest where most other investors are investing. This pattern is often observed among early stage startup investors.

-> What is Spark Funds’ business objective?

The business objectives and goals of data analysis are pretty straightforward.

Business objective: The objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and a suitable investment type for making investments. The overall strategy is to invest where others are investing, implying that the best sectors and countries are the ones where most investments are happening.
Goals of data analysis: Your goals are divided into three sub-goals:
Investment type analysis: Understanding investments in venture, seed/angel, private equity categories, etc. so Spark Funds can decide which type is best suited for its strategy.
Country analysis: Understanding which countries have had the most investments in the past. These will be Spark Funds’ favourites as well.
Sector analysis: Understanding the distribution of investments across the eight main sectors. (Note that we are interested in the eight main sectors provided in the mapping file. The two files — companies and rounds2 — have numerous sub-sector names; hence, you will need to map each sub-sector to its main sector.)
